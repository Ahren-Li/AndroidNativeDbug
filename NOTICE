    o The CLion developer team. Most of the core functions of gdb and lldb come from CLion.
    o The Google android plugin. It doesn't care me about adb-related features.

External code (based on other plugins' code, also noted in the class javadoc):
   o org.ahren.android.adb.AdbService
   o org.ahren.android.ui.ChooseSymbolDirectoryPanel
